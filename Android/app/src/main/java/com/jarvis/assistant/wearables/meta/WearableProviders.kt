/**
 * WearableDeviceProvider — connection / device-lifecycle surface.
 *
 * One concrete implementation per backend:
 *   - [StubMetaWearablesProvider] — returned when the DAT SDK is
 *     not present.  Reports SDK_UNAVAILABLE and refuses every call
 *     gracefully.
 *   - [MockMetaWearablesProvider] — pure in-memory simulation for
 *     dev / instrumented tests.
 *   - `RealMetaWearablesProvider` — added when the DAT SDK Maven
 *     coordinates are wired in (deferred to PR4.x; see
 *     `docs/wearables/meta-dat-integration.md`).
 *
 * All methods are suspend-safe and MUST NOT throw — surface failures
 * via the [stateFlow] (transitioning to ERROR) and / or return a
 * sealed-typed Result.  This is the contract that lets the rest of
 * Jarvis treat the wearables subsystem as optional.
