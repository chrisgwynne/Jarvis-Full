/**
 * ConversationClassifier — lightweight intent classifier that runs BEFORE ToolRegistry.
 *
 * Classifies every user utterance into a primary [ConversationIntent] so the routing
 * layer can decide whether any tools are needed, rather than letting every transcript
 * fall through to keyword-based tool matching.
 *
 * Priority order (first match wins):
 *   1. ACTION_REQUEST   — explicit device command (call, open, set alarm, etc.)
 *   2. PERSONAL_UPDATE  — user sharing something about themselves / their life
 *   3. REAL_WORLD_LOOKUP — requires live external data (weather, news, scores, prices)
 *   4. MEMORY_QUERY     — asking what Jarvis knows
 *   5. FOLLOW_UP_REPLY  — short fragment continuing an active exchange
 *   6. CASUAL_CHAT      — everything else; LLM handles naturally
