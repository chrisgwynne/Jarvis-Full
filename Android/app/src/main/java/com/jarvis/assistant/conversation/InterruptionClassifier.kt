/**
 * InterruptionClassifier — decides what to do with an utterance that arrived
 * while Jarvis was still speaking.
 *
 * ORDER OF CHECKS (first match wins):
 *   1. URGENT         — explicit stop / wait / hold-on / cancel phrases.
 *   2. CORRECTION     — "no", "actually", "I meant...", "wait, I..."
 *   3. CONTINUE       — "go on", "keep going", "carry on", "continue"
 *   4. CLARIFICATION  — question forms that share keywords with the response
 *                        OR short probing questions ("what do you mean?").
 *   5. REPLACEMENT    — first-person statement or command after a barge-in
 *                        that doesn't share topic with the response.
 *   6. UNRELATED      — anything else; treat as a fresh topic.
 *
 * DESIGN NOTE:
 *   Intentionally cheap and rule-based — the barge-in path is latency-sensitive.
 *   Wrong classifications are not catastrophic: they just mean the user may
 *   need to repeat themselves once.
