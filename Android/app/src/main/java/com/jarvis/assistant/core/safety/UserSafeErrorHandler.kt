/**
 * UserSafeErrorHandler — translate Throwables to short, calm, friendly
 * messages AND classify their severity so the upstream reporter knows
 * whether to file a GitHub issue.
 *
 * Pure / Android-free.  Callers (TTS pipeline, LLM fallback, the
 * Todoist router, …) hand in the Throwable + the [Area] that caught it
 * and get back a [SafeError] with the spoken text the user will hear.
 *
 * The spoken text is always one of the canonical strings — see
 * [Friendly] — never a string derived from the exception's own
 * `message` field.  Exception messages frequently contain stack info,
 * URLs, JSON, and tokens; we refuse to surface them.
