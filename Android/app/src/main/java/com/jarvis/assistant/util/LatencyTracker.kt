/**
 * LatencyTracker — lightweight pipeline timing for the Jarvis voice assistant.
 *
 * Two timers per pipeline run:
 *   • startMs    — wall clock at wake-word detection.
 *   • previousMs — wall clock at the most recent mark (for stage duration).
 *
 * Each `mark(label)` call logs both:
 *   • Cumulative time since pipeline start  (`label total=Xms`)
 *   • Time since the previous mark            (`stage=Yms`)
 *
 * The previous shape only logged cumulative time, which made it hard to spot
 * which single stage owned a regression — when the LLM call jumps from 800 ms
 * to 1.4 s you want to see that delta isolated, not buried in cumulative.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   LatencyTracker.pipelineStart()          // call at wake-word detection
 *   LatencyTracker.mark("STT_COMPLETE")     // call after each stage
 *   LatencyTracker.mark("LLM_FIRST_TOKEN")  // …
 *   LatencyTracker.reset()                  // call at end of pipeline (optional)
 *
 * All output goes to Logcat tag "JarvisLatency" at INFO level.
 * Filter with: adb logcat -s JarvisLatency
 *
 * Marks (in order of pipeline execution):
 *   WAKE_DETECTED        — wake word fired, pipeline beginning
 *   STT_START            — SpeechCapture.listen() called (mic open)
 *   STT_COMPLETE         — transcript received from speech capture
 *   FLOW_CHECKED         — FollowUpCoordinator.process() returned
 *   INTENT_CLASSIFIED    — IntentClassifier.classify() returned
 *   TOOL_MATCHED         — ToolRegistry.match() returned a result
 *   POLICY_EVALUATED     — ActionPolicyGate.evaluate() returned
 *   TOOL_EXECUTED        — tool.execute() returned
 *   LLM_REQUEST_START    — about to call LlmRouter
 *   LLM_FIRST_TOKEN      — first streamed token/sentence observed
 *   LLM_FIRST_SENTENCE   — first complete sentence ready for TTS
 *   LLM_STREAM_END       — final streamed token observed
 *   LLM_COMPLETE         — LLM response string received (non-streaming)
 *   TTS_START            — TtsEngine.speak() called for first sentence
 *   PIPELINE_DONE        — speakAndRecord() completed
 *
 * Budget: TARGET_FIRST_TOKEN_MS is the Phase-4 goal for end-of-speech to
 * first audible response token.  When LLM_FIRST_TOKEN exceeds this, the
 * tracker logs a WARN-level breach.
