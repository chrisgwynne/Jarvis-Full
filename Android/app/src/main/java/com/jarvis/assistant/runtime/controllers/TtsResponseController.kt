/**
 * TtsResponseController — the diagnostics-and-sample TTS surface.
 *
 * **Scope (this PR):**
 *   - `testSpeak(voiceName)` — voice-audition sample, used by Settings.
 *   - `speakProactivityTest(text, onResult)` — "Test spoken message"
 *     button.  Bypasses the Proactivity gate by design.
 *   - `dispatchProactivityGateTest(onResult)` — gate verdict reporter.
 *
 * **Out of scope (still on JarvisRuntime):**
 *   - the main pipeline TTS path (`streamAndSpeak`, `speakAndRecord`)
 *   - location-reminder + reminder-triggered TTS (couples to wake
 *     detector + audio focus + state machine; deferred to a future
 *     `SpeechSessionController` extraction).
 *
 * The controller takes its dependencies as constructor args + lambdas
 * (rather than holding a reference to `JarvisRuntime`) so it stays
 * pure-ish and JVM-testable.  See
 * `docs/architecture/runtime-split.md` for the broader plan.
