/**
 * Tool — the single interface every Jarvis action implements.
 *
 * DESIGN INTENT:
 *   Each tool is self-describing: it knows its name, whether it needs the
 *   internet, which permissions it requires, and how to pattern-match a
 *   transcript.  The ToolRegistry calls matches() on each tool in order;
 *   the first match wins.
 *
 * ADDING A NEW TOOL:
 *   1. Create a class in tools/device/ or tools/web/ that implements Tool.
 *   2. Register it in ToolRegistry.buildDefault().
 *   That's it — no changes elsewhere.
