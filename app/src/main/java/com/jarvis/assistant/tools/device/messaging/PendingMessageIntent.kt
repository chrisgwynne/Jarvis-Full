/**
 * PendingMessageIntent — a half-built messaging command stashed by the
 * runtime when slots are missing ("send a WhatsApp" → channel known,
 * recipient + body still missing).
 *
 * The runtime parks one of these whenever a messaging utterance is
 * recognised but cannot be executed yet, speaks a local clarifying
 * question, and intercepts the NEXT user utterance before AttentionGate
 * can filter it.  The next-turn intercept merges the new tokens into the
 * stash and runs [MessagePipeline] as soon as both slots are full.
 *
 * Why it lives here (not in JarvisRuntime):
 *   - Pure data + a small static merger.  Unit-testable without Android.
 *   - Holds both the channel and the partial slots so the runtime doesn't
 *     have to re-parse the original utterance.
 *
 * Lifetime: a single instance lives at most [TTL_MS] before being
 * dropped.  The runtime is the sole owner; this class never schedules
 * its own expiry.
