package com.jarvis.assistant.todoist.parse

/**
 * TodoistListQueryParser — recognises read-only "show me my tasks"
 * style utterances and produces a [Query] describing which slice of
 * the user's Todoist list to fetch.
 *
 * Strictly local — no LLM, no remote routing.  Returns null when the
 * utterance isn't a recognised query so the caller falls through to
 * the normal pipeline.
 *
 * Why this exists: without query recognition the LLM fallback was
 * answering "I don't have a task list feature" — the user had Todoist
 * connected but Jarvis didn't realise the LIST-side of the
 * integration existed.  This parser closes the gap.
 *
 * Supported forms:
 *
 *   - "what are my tasks" / "what's on my list" / "show my todoist"
 *   - "list my tasks" / "list my todos" / "list my reminders"
 *   - "what's on for today" / "today's tasks" / "what's due today"
 *   - "what's tomorrow's tasks" / "what tasks do I have tomorrow"
 *   - "watch tomorrow's tasks" (STT correction for "what's tomorrow's")
 *   - "what's overdue" / "show overdue tasks" / "anything overdue"
 *   - "what's coming up" / "upcoming tasks" / "what's coming this week"
 *   - "search tasks for <X>" / "find task about <X>"
 *   - "how many tasks do I have"
